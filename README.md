## üìÅ Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Main application with Niko and memory agents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                    # OpenAI configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home_memories.json      # Stored memories (auto-created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.ps1                # PowerShell run script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_niko_memory.py     # Memory functionality test
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

Test the memory system:
```bash
python test_niko_memory.py
```

The test will:
1. Tell Niko about family information
2. Ask Niko to recall the information
3. Verify that the memory system is working

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All memories are stored locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external services except OpenAI for processing
- You have full control over your stored information
- Memory file can be backed up or deleted as needed

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify your OpenAI API key is correct in `.env`
2. Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
4. Check the console output for detailed error messages

## üéØ Usage Tips

- **Be specific**: The more details you give Niko, the better it can help you
- **Use categories**: Mention if something is about family, home maintenance, schedules, etc.
- **Ask for summaries**: "What do you remember about..." to get stored information
- **Update information**: Tell Niko when things change, and it will update the memories

Welcome to your new AI-powered home management system with Niko! üè†ü§ñ

A multi-agent AI system built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel and OpenAI's o1 model. This application demonstrates agent orchestration with handoff capabilities between three specialized agents: Manager, Developer, and Project Manager.

## Key Features

- **Manager Agent**: Provides strategic direction, coordinates teams, and handles high-level decisions
- **Developer Agent**: Handles technical specifications, code reviews, and development estimates
- **Project Manager Agent**: Manages timelines, resources, and project coordination
- **Dynamic Handoff**: Agents can intelligently transfer conversations to the most appropriate specialist
- **Conversation Memory**: Agents maintain context across the entire conversation and can reference previous discussions
- **Console Interface**: Interactive command-line interface for seamless communication

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key with access to o1-preview model
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Agentic-AI-Home-Assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Copy the `.env` file and update it with your OpenAI credentials:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=o1-preview
   OPENAI_ORG_ID=your_organization_id_here  # Optional
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Examples

Once the application is running, you can interact with the agents using natural language. Here are some example interactions:

### Project Management
- "I need to create a timeline for a new mobile app project with a team of 5 developers"
- "Track the progress of project ABC-123"
- "Allocate 3 senior developers to the authentication feature"

### Development Tasks
- "Estimate the development time for implementing user authentication with OAuth"
- "Create a technical specification for a real-time chat feature"
- "Review the performance of our database queries"

### Strategic Decisions
- "What should be our priority for the next quarter's development?"
- "I need help deciding between microservices and monolithic architecture"
- "Create a high-level task for implementing AI features"

## Agent Capabilities

### Manager Agent
- Strategic planning and decision making
- Resource allocation coordination
- Team coordination and task management
- Business objective alignment

### Developer Agent
- Technical specification creation
- Development time estimation
- Code review and quality assessment
- Architecture recommendations

### Project Manager Agent
- Project timeline creation and management
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Resource allocation and coordination
- Milestone and dependency management

## How It Works

The system uses Microsoft Semantic Kernel's agent orchestration with handoff capabilities and automatic memory management. When you submit a request:

1. **Initial Processing**: The Manager Agent initially receives your request
2. **Context Awareness**: All agents have access to the complete conversation history
3. **Smart Routing**: Based on the content, agents either handle requests directly or hand off to appropriate specialists
4. **Memory Preservation**: Each handoff maintains the conversation context, so agents can reference previous discussions
5. **Specialized Functions**: Each agent has access to specialized plugins with relevant functions
6. **Continuous Context**: The conversation continues with full memory until task completion

### Memory Management

The **HandoffOrchestration** automatically manages conversation memory through:

- **Shared Conversation History**: All agents can access and reference the complete conversation
- **Context Preservation**: When agents hand off to each other, the full context is maintained
- **Cross-Agent Memory**: An agent can reference decisions made by other agents earlier in the conversation
- **Persistent Context**: Information from early in the conversation remains available throughout

### Example Memory Usage

1. **User**: "I want to build a calculator app"
2. **Manager**: Discusses project scope and requirements
3. **User**: "For the calculator we discussed, what technology should I use?"
4. **Developer**: References the calculator project from step 1 and provides technical recommendations
5. **User**: "Create a timeline for the calculator project with that technology"
6. **Project Manager**: References both the calculator project and technology choice to create timeline

## Technical Architecture

- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's AI orchestration framework
- **OpenAI o1-preview**: Advanced reasoning model for complex problem solving
- **Agent Plugins**: Modular functions for specific domain tasks
- **Handoff Orchestration**: Dynamic agent routing based on context

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Model to use (default: o1-preview)
- `OPENAI_ORG_ID`: Your OpenAI organization ID (optional)

### Supported Models
While configured for o1-preview, the system can work with other OpenAI models:
- gpt-4
- gpt-4-turbo
- gpt-3.5-turbo

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **API Key Issues**: Verify your OpenAI API key is correct and has proper permissions

3. **Model Access**: Ensure your account has access to the o1-preview model

4. **Rate Limits**: The o1 models have lower rate limits - if you encounter limits, consider switching to gpt-4
